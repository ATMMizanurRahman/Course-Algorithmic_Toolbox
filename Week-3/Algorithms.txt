1.Greedy choice is to choose many as possible number of largest coins.

2.The key points here are selecting max index from value/weight. Add that value to result and clean that value in original list.

4. Easy

5.The greedy choice is selecting the minimum right endpoint. Then remove all segments that contains that endpoint. Keep choosing minimum right endpoint and removing segments.

6. The greedy choice is choosing smallest number from 1, 2, …Sum them as S. If your smallest number is larger than (input_number— S)/ 2. You found the last number. Why? please take a look at assignment details[2].

7.This problem has many edge cases. Base on the pseudocode above, the main point is checking “digit ≥ maxDigit” in the right way. Because it’s not only digit anymore, you have to make sure that 12 and 2 => 221, 22 and 225 => 22522….To do that, the strategy of comparing two number is:
